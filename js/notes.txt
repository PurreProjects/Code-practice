Create object = "x = {}"

object {
    property: value
}

object.property = dot notation

object['property'] = bracket notation
Bracket notation is used when dot notation doesnt work, e.g.
when the property is called delivery-time, the "-" is handled like a minus and it tried to do math.



delete object.property = delete property

Object is just a value. You can save objects into variables.

Objects are used to organize code.

Instead of having alot of different variables for related data. 
e.g. name, gender, age of a person, we can save that into an object instead of several variables

We can store any type of value in an object. e.g.

object1 = {
    name: 'Bosse',
    object2: {
        property2: name2:
    }
}

This is called an nested object, its used for organizing values that refers to the same property
we can access object2 by object1.object2.property2

We can also create fucntions inside of objects since functions are also a type of value.

Function inside of object is called a method.

JSON = JavaScript Object notation
Used to translate objects to JSON, since JSON is a universal language, it's used to communicate between computers that talk different languages
